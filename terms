			<h1>Bar Roulette Terms of Service</h1>
			<p>Last Updated: December 15, 2016</p>
			<p>Code & Kit LLC ("Code & Kit," "we," "us," "our") provides its services (described below) to you through its mobile application ("Service", "App"), subject to the following Terms of Service (as amended from time to time, the "Terms of Service"). We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change or modify portions of these Terms of Service at any time. If we do this, we will post the changes on this page and will indicate at the top of this page the date these terms were last revised. Your continued use of the App after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service. If you do not agree to abide by these or any future Terms of Service, do not use or access the Service.</p>
			<h2>Access and Use of the Service</h2>
			<p><strong>Services Description:</strong> The Bar Roulette Service is designed to assist users in finding a bar or restaurant. It attempts to find a bar using data from Yelp or Foursquare's API. After it has found a bar the Service tells the user how far away the location is and the expected Uber fare. If the user agrees, it will request an Uber on their behalf and the Uber will take them to the location.</p>
			<p><strong>Modifications to Service:</strong> Code & Kit reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice. You agree that Code & Kit shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Service.</p>
			<h2>Indemnity and Release</h2>
			<p>You agree to release, indemnify and hold Code & Kit and its affiliates and their officers, employees, directors and agent harmless from any and all losses, damages, expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, rights, claims, actions of any kind and injury (including death) arising out of or relating to your use of the Service, your connection to the Service, your violation of these Terms of Service or your violation of any rights of another. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor." If you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute or doctrine.</p>
			<p>Your use of the Service is at your sole risk. The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. Code & Kit expressly disclaims all liability. Code & Kit makes no warranty that the Service will meet your expectations or the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free.</p>
      <p>By using the Service you agree to abide by the Terms and Conditions of <a href="https://www.uber.com/legal/terms/us/">Uber</a>, <a href="https://www.yelp.com/static?p=tos">Yelp</a> and <a href="https://foursquare.com/legal/terms">Foursquare</a>.</p>
			<p><strong>If you are dissatisfied with any portion of the Service or with these Terms of Service, your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue use of the Service.</strong></p>
