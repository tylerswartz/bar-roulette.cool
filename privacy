			<h1>Bar Roulette Privacy Policy</h1>
			<p>Effective Date: April 1, 2016</p>
			<p>This privacy policy discloses the privacy practices for the Bar Roulette iOS App ("App"). This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by this App. It will notify you of the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What personally identifiable information is collected from you, how it is used and with whom it may be shared.</li>
				<li>What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data.</li>
				<li>The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.</li>
				<li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</li>		
			</ul>
			<h2>Account Information Collection, Use, and Sharing</h2>
			<p>We are the sole owners of the account information collected on this site. We only have access to limited information collected when you log in with your Uber credentials.</p>
			<p>In order to use this App, a user must first log in with their Uber account. Only your first name, last name, email address and your unique Uber identifier is given to this App. To find a bar and submit a ride request to Uber you are required to enable Location Services on your mobile device. Your ride start location and end location is stored, along with the selected bar name. This information is saved to enhance your future use of the App.</p>
			<p>We will not sell, rent or share your information with any third party, except for Uber as necessary to fulfill your ride request.</p>
			<h2>Your Access to and Control Over Information</h2>
			<p>You can do the following at any time by contacting us via email:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>See what data we have about you, if any.</li>
				<li>Change/correct any data we have about you.</li>
				<li>Have us delete any data we have about you.</li>
				<li>Express any concern you have about our use of your data.</li>		
			</ul>
			<h2>Information Collected Using Technologies</h2>
			<p>Like many app operators, we use automated data collection tools to collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use our App, like a device identifier, user settings, and the operating system of your device, as well as information about your use of our App. Some third party services providers that we engage may also track and report information about how and when you interact with our App and information about your mobile device (such as device hardware, operating system, and location). We may use that information to customize and improve our App.</p>
			<h2>Security</h2>
			<p>We take reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect the information that we collect from or about you from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.</p>
			<h2>Sharing</h2>
			<p>We may share aggregated App usage information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.</p>
			<h2>Updates</h2>
			<p>Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time and all updates will be posted on this page.</p>
			<p>If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us immediately via email at hello@codeandkit.com.</p>
